# Post Event Report Blind Coding 14 December 2023

## Attendance :dancers:

The attendance was a little less than expected. We had expected for around 200 - 250 participants but, only around 100 people managed to attend the event. The attendees were mostly freshmen who had limited knowledge about the basics of Computer Science and Github

## Venue :school:

We had conducted this event in our Lecture Gallery. We feel that the venue was ample and appropriate for the same.

## Planning vs Implementation :paperclip:


The amount of swag the we had recieved was more than enough. We had distributed all the swags to all the participants and were a little lenient to the winners to take some more swags with them since we had a few extras.


## Positives :+1:

- The planning and the execution of the event went really well.
- Everyone, especially the freshers were interested for the next chapter of the event.
- We had custom build an evalutation tool to evaluate the codes.
  

## Negatives :-1:

- The custom evaluation tool that we had build only worked partially.
- We faced issues regarding result declaration since the evaluation tool did not work as expected.
